# China Greenhouse Gas Mitigation from Coal to Natural Gas

This is an environmental data visualization project I cooperated with a PHD student. 

This project demonstrates how much greenhouse gas - CO2, CH4 and N2O - we can save from switching partical energy consumption from coal to natural gas.

Use arrow keys - up, down, left, right - to navigate through consumption ratio and years.
